# CMIS242.Project2
Sales Tax Calculator - Second graded project for CMIS 242

This program accepts user input for a vehicle make, model, and purchase price then calculates the sales tax based on the type of vehicle (Electric, Hybrid, or Other). 

The following concepts were applied in completing this project:
* Object Oriented Programming
* Input exception handling
* Java Swing
* Event handling
* Conditional branching
* Abstract Classes

This project taught me some more of the basics of checking input through text boxes, using radio buttons to set attributes of other components as well as controlling the logic of the program, creating and extending abstract classes, and made me more comfortable using the NetBeans IDE.
